## Programs

### keygen

Derives the public key and a public, untrusted cache from the secret key.

- **Inputs:** secret key.
- **Outputs:** public key and cache, or failure.
- **Context:** enclave.

### sign

Produces a compact signature for a given message.

- **Inputs:** secret key, cache, message.
- **Outputs:** signature or failure.
- **Context:** enclave.

### expand

Converts the signature into a verification witness.

Example: It may restore pruned Merkle paths or copy the signature when `S = W`.

- **Inputs:** message, public key, signature.
- **Outputs:** witness or failure.
- **Context:** prover host.

### verify

Checks whether the witness authenticates the message under the public key.

- **Inputs:** message, public key, witness.
- **Outputs:** accept or reject.
- **Context:** zkVM.

## Model and costs

### Random oracle

All programs share one random oracle H that maps each input to an independent uniform 32-byte answer. The adversary in the [security game](#security) queries the same H, and the Lean security proofs are carried out in this model. Security counts calls to H.

### RISC-V programs

Each program is an [RV64IM](#risc-v-interface) program with one extra instruction, `HASH(input, n, output)`, issued as a [system call](#system-calls). It reads n bytes starting at address `input`, queries H on them, and writes the 32-byte answer at address `output`. The input and output addresses must both be multiples of 8, and so must n. Hashing n bytes costs `max(1, ⌈n / 64⌉)` compressions.

| Operation                                                                                                       | Cost                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ordinary instruction                                                                                            | 1 cycle                                                |
| Multiplication or division: `MUL`, `MULH`, `MULHSU`, `MULHU`, `DIV`, `DIVU`, `REM`, `REMU`, and their `W` forms | 4 cycles                                               |
| HASH                                                                                                            | 8 cycles per compression (no extra instruction charge) |
| HALT                                                                                                            | 1 cycle                                                |

Verification also pays for its witness: `⌈W / 256⌉` cycles.

## Required Lean statements

### Completeness

For any `secretKey`, `message` and oracle H, consider the following experiment:

1. `keygen(secretKey)` returns the `public key` and `cache`.
2. `sign(secretKey, cache, message)` returns the `signature`.
3. `expand(message, public key, signature)` returns the `witness`.
4. `verify(message, public key, witness)` returns the verdict.

Stop at the first failure. We say the `experiment succeeds` when all stages succeed and verification accepts.

`K_P` counts program P's compressions; it is zero if P is never reached. `BUDGET_P` denotes P's named budget.

1. **Success:** for every secret key, `Pr_H[experiment succeeds for every message] >= 1 - FAILURE`.
2. **Compression budgets:** for every secret key and P in {`keygen`, `sign`, `expand`}, `E_{H,M}[2^(K_P / BUDGET_P)] <= 2`.

`Pr_H` is over H; `E_{H,M}` is over an independently sampled random oracle H and uniform 32-byte message M.

**Remark.** After H is fixed, adaptively chosen messages may cost much more than this average. Any scheme can rule this out by signing the message hashed with a salt derived from the secret key and the message, and carried in the signature. This costs only 16 signature bytes and one hash, so we prefer to rely on this heuristic rather than complicating the rules.

3. **Verification cycles:** for every secret key, message and oracle, if the experiment succeeds, [`verify`](#verify)'s cycles plus the witness charge `⌈W / 256⌉` are at most [`C`](#submission).

### Security

Consider the following experiment for a classical probabilistic adversary `A` with unrestricted computation and an integer hash-call budget `Q >= 1`:

1. Sample H and a uniform secret key independently. Initialize an empty transcript T and count all calls to H throughout the experiment.
2. Run `keygen(secretKey)`. Failure ends the experiment without a win; otherwise give `A` the public key and cache.
3. `A` may then adaptively query two oracles:
   - **`random_oracle(input_A)`:** return H(input_A).
   - **`signing_oracle(message_A, cache_A)`:** run `sign(secretKey, cache_A, message_A)` using the original secret key. Return the signature or failure. Add each returned `(message_A, signature)` to T. Allow at most `LIFETIME` requests.
4. `A` makes one final submission, choosing either form below:
   - **witness weak unforgeability:** submit `(message_A, witness_A)`. `A` wins if `verify(message_A, public key, witness_A)` accepts, and no pair in T has message `message_A`, and the total hash-call count is at most Q
   - **signature strong unforgeability:** submit `(message_A, signature_A)`. `A` wins if `expand(message_A, public key, signature_A)` returns a witness that `verify` accepts, and `(message_A, signature_A)` is not in T, and the total hash-call count is at most Q.

The total hash-call count includes key generation, signing, `A`’s queries, and final expansion and verification when performed.

**Security:** for every A and `Q >= 1`, `Pr[A wins] <= Q / 2^SECURITY_BITS`, over the secret key, H, and `A`’s private randomness.

### Program requirements

1. **Termination:** every program terminates with a result or failure in fewer than `CYCLE_LIMIT` cycles, for every input and oracle.

## RISC-V interface

Use [RV64I](https://docs.riscv.org/reference/isa/v20260120/unpriv/rv64.html) and the [M extension](https://docs.riscv.org/reference/isa/v20260120/unpriv/m-st-ext.html).

Each program satisfies **`4 × instruction count + embedded-data bytes < MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`**, checked directly at submission.

### Code and memory

Code occupies a separate, immutable instruction address space. Instruction i is at `0x1000 + 4 × i`.

Memory occupies `0x000000`–`0xFFFFFF` (16 MiB), including embedded data, inputs, outputs, scratch space, and stack. The verifier enforces this range directly; it is not a separate Lean proof obligation.

Load D embedded bytes at `data_base = 16 × floor((0x1000000 - D) / 16)`. Initially, `sp = data_base` and `PC = 0x1000`; all other integer registers are zero.

### Inputs and outputs

Each submission specifies six byte offsets, shared by all four programs: δ<sub>message</sub>, δ<sub>secret key</sub>, δ<sub>public key</sub>, δ<sub>cache</sub>, δ<sub>signature</sub>, and δ<sub>witness</sub>. Each gives the memory address where that object is written or read. The buffers have the sizes in [Parameters](#parameters), start at 8-byte-aligned addresses, do not overlap, and end at or below `data_base` for every program.

Before each execution, memory is zero except for embedded data and the inputs listed under [Programs](#programs); unused object buffers remain zero. For example, before [`sign`](#sign), write the secret key, cache, and message at their offsets. On success, read the signature at δ<sub>signature</sub>.

HALT ends execution with exit code `a0`: `0` means success and any other value failure. For [`verify`](#verify), these mean acceptance and rejection, respectively.

### System calls

ECALL selects one of two services through `t0`:

| `t0` | Service | Arguments                                                                 |
| ---: | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    0 | HASH    | `a0 = input address`, `a1 = input length in bytes`, `a2 = output address` |
|    1 | HALT    | `a0 = exit code` (0 = success)                                            |

HASH writes H's 32-byte answer at the output address.

### Further Details

- **Proof checking:** the certificate must pass Lean’s kernel against the organizer’s definitions. Its transitive axiom dependencies may contain only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- **Instructions:** encodings are 32 bits. Fetching outside the code or at a non-4-byte-aligned address fails. `FENCE` has no effect; `EBREAK` fails.
- **Registers:** `x0`–`x31` are 64 bits. `x0` always reads zero and ignores writes. Aliases are `sp = x2`, `t0 = x5`, and `a0`–`a2 = x10`–`x12`. PC is separate.
- **Memory access:** addresses count bytes; multi-byte integers are little-endian. Loads and stores access only memory, not code. Accesses of 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes require alignment to their size. Misaligned accesses fail.
- **Bounds:** every memory access and buffer must fit completely in memory. For unsigned byte address p and length n, require `p + n <= 0x1000000`. All size, layout, and bounds calculations use mathematical integers without overflow. Instruction arithmetic and effective-address calculation follow RV64IM.
- **HASH arguments:** addresses and byte length n are unsigned 64-bit values. The input and output addresses must both be 8-byte aligned, and n must be a multiple of 8. The input’s n bytes and the output’s 32 bytes must fit entirely in memory. Check all of this before any oracle call or write.
- **HASH execution:** read the n input bytes in increasing address order; H’s input is their `8n` bits, least-significant bit first within each byte. Read all input before writing the answer, so buffers may overlap. Preserve integer registers and advance PC by 4.

## Lean project

`SigGolf.Certificate submission C` in [SigGolf/Statements.lean](SigGolf/Statements.lean) is the competition claim for the exact four program images and declared sizes. [SigGolf/Security.lean](SigGolf/Security.lean) defines the attacker and both forgery experiments; [SigGolf/Riscv.lean](SigGolf/Riscv.lean) defines execution and costs.

Build the statements and regression checks with `lake build SigGolf SigGolfTests`. Dependencies are pinned in `lake-manifest.json`. These files define the requirements; they do not certify a particular signature scheme.
