Copy presentation.json and scheme.svg into presentation/ beside submission/. Replace the example with your scheme: signature fields and byte offsets, encoding, authentication path, witness expansion, and public key.

Replace the profile placeholders with totals over N accepting RISC-V runs: samples=N, instructions={mnemonic: count} with HALT=N, and hashes={input_bit_length: call_count}, where the bit length is 8 times HASH's byte length (a nonzero multiple of 512). Describe the sample in method. Do not pre-average; the site computes per-run counts and cycles, including 4-cycle multiplication and division instructions and the witness charge.

Each file: at most 64 KiB. SVG: static, without scripts or external resources. Display data is labeled “Provided by submission · not verified” and does not affect scoring.
